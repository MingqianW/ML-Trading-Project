# Deep Reinforcement Learning Trading Project

This project is inspired by [this blog post](https://blog.mlq.ai/deep-reinforcement-learning-trading-project/). 

## Project Overview
- **Data and Scripts**: The data and scripts for preparing data are stored in the `data` folder.
- **Implemented Parts**:
  1. **LSTM**
  2. **CNN**
  3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

For more details on current progress and issues, refer to the `issue_log.md` file.

## Next Steps
The next step is to:
1. Improve the performance of the implemented parts (LSTM, CNN, and RL).
2. Complete the final part of the project: **Combine the Models & Deploy at Interactive Brokers**.

## Folder Structure
- **`CNN/LSTM` and `LSTM_8_indicators`**:
  - These folders contain the models and their data preparation scripts.
  
- **`CNN_result`**:
  - Stores the evaluation and test results for the CNN model.

- **`LSTM_eval`**:
  - Stores the evaluation and test results for the LSTM model.
