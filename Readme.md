The project is inspired by "https://blog.mlq.ai/deep-reinforcement-learning-trading-project/".
Data and script of preparing data is stored in data folder.
Currently, I implement first three parts: LSTM, CNN and RL. For more detail, see issue_log.md. The next step is to improve the performance of implemented parts and complete the last part:Combine the Models & Deploy at Interactive Brokers.
